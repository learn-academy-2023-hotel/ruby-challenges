# üèî Stretch Goals

# As a developer, I can keep a collection of two of each Animal.
# Hint: You'll want to add your Animals into an array.
# As a developer, I can sort my collection of Animals based on age.
# Hint: Find out how the spaceship operator can help you with an array.
# As a developer, I can utilize a Ruby module to help DRY up my code. I can create a swim method inside of my module that will apply to Animals who can swim. This method should return "I can swim!"
# Hint: Look into module mix ins. Since not all animals can swim, only certain Animals will have access to this module.
